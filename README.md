# EdwinPropierty ‚Äì Student Academic Management API

This project is a backend REST API for managing students, courses, and academic records. It allows you to create, update, retrieve, and delete students and their academic histories, including course registrations and grades.

## üß† How It Works

- The API manages students, courses, and academic records using MongoDB as the database.
- It provides endpoints to:
  - Register and update students and their academic histories.
  - Add, update, or remove course records for each student.
  - Retrieve student information and their academic performance.

## üìÇ Features

- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on students and academic records.
- Partial updates supported for academic registers.
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for all operations.
- Handles edge cases such as missing students or courses gracefully.
